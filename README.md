Authentication
This app uses streamlit-authenticator for login and password management. Credentials are loaded from config.yaml.

Temporary Passwords
Non-admin users with temporary passwords are forced to update on first login.

Once updated, they're logged out and asked to re-authenticate.

Role-based Access
Users are assigned a role (e.g., admin, user) in config.yaml. Access to data is filtered accordingly.

📝 Features
✅ Secure Login
python
Copy
Edit
authenticator = stauth.Authenticate(
    config["credentials"],
    config["cookie"]["name"],
    config["cookie"]["key"],
    config["cookie"]["expiry_days"]
)
Lead Management
Users are shown only the leads assigned to them

A dropdown lets users select a customer and record a call

all Actions
Tick “Mark as called”

Enter a comment

Submit call updates to backend storage via save_call_actions

📜 Call History + Audit Trail
Historical call records are shown per customer

Each access is logged using:

python
Copy
Edit
log_event(username, selected, CALL_AUDIT_PATH)
🛠️ Configuration
config.yaml
yaml
Copy
Edit
credentials:
  usernames:
    johndoe:
      email: john@example.com
      name: John Doe
      password: hashed_password
      role: user

cookie:
  name: some_cookie_name
  key: some_cookie_key
  expiry_days: 30

metadata:
  temporary_passwords:
    - johndoe
To generate hashed passwords:

python
Copy
Edit
import streamlit_authenticator as stauth
hashed = stauth.Hasher(['yourpassword']).generate()
print(hashed)
📈 Example Usage Flow
User logs in

App checks if it's a temporary password

If yes → prompts for password change

User sees their assigned customers

Picks one, views details and logs a call

Submission saves action + logs access

📌 Notes
Admins are exempt from forced password reset

All usernames must be unique

customer_id is treated as a string key
